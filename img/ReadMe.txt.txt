P.S. - Thank you for all of the effort that you put into this semester
       to supply us with the needed content for the class. I know it must 
       have been difficult but the both of us appreciate the time you put
       into each lecture and for all of the times you helped us. We learned
       alot this semester! Thanks and hope that you have a great summer!!!
